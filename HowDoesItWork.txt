Our idea is that we will have a bot for this code. Parents can install this bot on thier mobiles/OS.
On installation, parents can provide thier email ID.
It will attach itself to the mobile/OS and record all the chat going on in any games present.
Now, it will try to analyze the chat using our program.

Algorithm used by our program:
    It has a database of words which are inappropriate
    It goes through each word of the chat and checks in the database if that word is present
    If it is present, it will send an email to the parents
    For checking phishing links, we are using google safe APIs (https://safebrowsing.googleapis.com/v4/)
    For checking abusive content, we are using hugging face model API (https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/unitary/toxic-bert)
